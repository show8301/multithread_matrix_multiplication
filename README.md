# Multithread Matrix Multiplication  

=========================================================

### Motivation
This is an study work from one of my master's class in NTUT.  

### Purpose
The main purpose of this work is to test multithread's parallel processing performance.  

### Content
**In this work:**  
1. Generate two fixed size matrix with random int   
2. Multiply two matrix with three different ways:  
	2-1. traditional for loops  
	2-2. omp with static scheduler (50 threads)   
	2-3. omp with dynamic scheduler (10 threads)  
	
	
### Summarize
It's just a trash work (I really do think so).  
But I'm still welcome for any opinions or judgements.
